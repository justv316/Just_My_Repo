# Natalie and Vanessa Ruby Sapphire Nuzlocke

## Rules

	0. Each person will play the game up until major events (Badges, story events, legendary encounters) as organized in this document
	
	1. Any Pokémon that faints must be released or boxed permanently. It is considered “dead” for the rest of the challenge.
	Only the first wild Pokémon encountered in a route or area can be caught. 
	
	2. If the player fails to catch it (ie. it flees or faints), their opportunity to catch a Pokémon in that area is lost.
	
	3. The player must nickname all Pokémon they catch or obtain. (This is not technically necessary for the challenge run, but is universally accepted as part of a Nuzlocke.)
	
	4. Pokemon must never exceed the stated level cap based on game point.
	
	5. You may not catch Pokemon in cities by Surfing/Fishing. You may catch pokemon in routes using these means, but only as the first encounter of that route. 
	

## Clauses

	0. Duplicate: If the first Pokémon in an area is one the player already owns, they may continue battling until they encounter one they do not own, and then attempt to catch it. This rule prevents a player from having multiples of the same Pokémon, especially early in the game when the selection of different Pokémon on the first few routes is limited.
	
	1. Shiny: If the player encounters a shiny wild Pokémon, they may catch it, even if a wild Pokémon has already been encountered in that area. This does not count as the encounter for that area.
